Hello and Welcome to ResumeAPI, a personal project that I took on to learn more about backend/api development, databases, and servers.

My name is Anthony Lee, a senior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa studying Management Information Systems and Computer Science. My career interest is in Software Engineering, specifically backend or fullstack. 

In order to hone my skills and prepare for the job market, I developed this project in order to showcase my development skills, my commitment to learning, and also give anyone who wants to see my resume a cool way to do so in my own way.
